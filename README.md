## FishStockManagement
It is an basic Inventory management application.
Application having 4 pages in it.
1) List Items
2) Add Items
3) Update Items
4) Stock Details
5) Export to csv

Now here's a catch, while List and Add you can see over Navbar easily. But if you hover the mouse click on "Name"  in the table, it will redirect you to "Update page" and
once click on "Quantity In Store" you will redirect to "Stock_detail" page, which I am planning to continue.

Future aspects:
1) I want to build Home page like user friendly dashboard 
2) with Graphs, Pie chart 
3) tabular data and 
4) cards component with real time numbers on it.
5) I will add Date filter too
